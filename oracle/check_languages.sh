# Description:
#   This script tests which Oracle Cloud documentation language URLs return HTTP 200 (OK).
#   It reads a list of language codes and names from a file (languages.txt),
#   replaces the "en" in the base URL with each code,
#   and performs the check in parallel.
#
#   Supported URLs are written to supported_languages.txt
#   Unsupported URLs are written to unsupported_languages.txt
#
#   This demonstrates parallel execution and robust reporting.

#Initial idea was to show progress, but it gets messy with concurrent jobs
#-----------------------------
  # Increment progress safely (each job reports completion to the console)
  # /dev/tty ensures output goes to the parent/controlling terminal even from background jobs

  #echo "$((++COMPLETED)) / $TOTAL_LANGS completed" > /dev/tty

  # /dev/tty:
# This special device file refers to the controlling terminal (the screen/keyboard
# session) of the process that opens it. Writing to /dev/tty forces output to the
# user's screen immediately, bypassing any shell redirection or buffering of stdout.
# It is essential for displaying interactive prompts or real-time status messages
# from background jobs, ensuring they are always visible to the user.

# üõë PROGRESS TRACKING FAILURE NOTE (Subshell Variable Scope)
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# The initial attempt to track progress using a simple variable counter (e.g., ((COMPLETED++)))
# failed because background jobs ('&') run in isolated environments called subshells.
#
# 1. VARIABLE ISOLATION: Each subshell receives its own COPY of the parent script's
#    variables (like $COMPLETED) and can only modify its own copy.
# 2. NO RETURN: When the subshell exits, its updated variable value is DESTROYED and 
#    is NEVER passed back to the parent shell.
#
# This means the parent script's counter remains inaccurate (often 0).
#
# A reliable solution requires an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism, such
# as a dedicated temporary file or named pipe, to allow the concurrent subshells
# to safely communicate their completion status to the parent script.
